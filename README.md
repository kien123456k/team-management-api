This is a simple API that I created to have fun with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/).

docker-compose up -d
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è For local environment
- Firstly, you need to install [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and then start it as a background service.
- Secondly, replace `MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017` with `MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017`
- Finally, run command:
```
yarn start:local
```
## ‚ú®Some additional commands
